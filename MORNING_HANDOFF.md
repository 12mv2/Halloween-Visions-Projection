# 🌅 Morning Team Handoff - Halloween VLC Projection

## 🎉 Current Status: SYSTEM TESTED & WORKING ✅

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-22 Evening  
**Next Step**: Projector testing and production deployment

---

## ✅ What's Working (Tested Tonight)

### 🎥 Core System
- **VLC Integration**: python-vlc working perfectly
- **Hand Detection**: YOLO model detecting hands at 99-100% confidence
- **Video Switching**: sleeping_face.mp4 ↔ angry_face.mp4 seamlessly
- **Camera Support**: Both USB external and built-in cameras functional
- **State Machine**: 2-second scare duration with automatic return to idle

### 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied
- **USB Camera Initialization**: Added 2-second delay + retry logic for reliable USB camera access
- **Camera Index Mapping**: 
  - Camera 0: USB external camera (works with laptop lid closed)
  - Camera 1: Built-in laptop camera (works with lid open)

## 🎯 Next Steps for Morning Team

### 1. **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Projector Testing**
```bash
# Connect projector to laptop
# Test display detection
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --list-displays

# Test fullscreen projection (replace X with projector display index)
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --source 0 --fullscreen-display X

# Test with both cameras
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --source 1 --fullscreen-display X
```

### 2. **Production Deployment Test**
- Set up projector in final location
- Test camera positioning for optimal hand detection
- Verify video switching performance in production environment
- Test system stability (30+ minute run)

### 3. **Optional Enhancements**
- Adjust scare duration if needed (`--scare-duration 3.0`)
- Fine-tune confidence threshold if false positives occur (`--scare-conf 0.95`)
- Test different video content if needed

## 🚀 Ready-to-Run Commands

### Basic Testing
```bash
# Test hand detection with preview
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --show --debug

# List available cameras
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --list-cameras

# List available displays  
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --list-displays
```

### Production Commands
```bash
# Use USB camera with projector (recommended for flexibility)
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --source 0 --fullscreen-display 1

# Use built-in camera with projector
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --source 1 --fullscreen-display 1

# Emergency stop: Ctrl+C
```

## 🔧 Known Working Configuration

- **macOS**: Fully tested and working
- **VLC**: 3.0.21 installed via Homebrew
- **Python**: All dependencies in requirements.txt installed
- **Cameras**: Both USB and built-in tested and functional
- **Videos**: H.264 MP4 format, 1920x1080 resolution
- **YOLO Model**: best.pt trained for hand detection

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Camera Issues
```bash
# If camera not working, try different index
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --source 0
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --source 1

# Check camera permissions in System Preferences
```

### VLC Issues
```bash
# Test basic VLC functionality
python test_vlc_playback.py --video videos/sleeping_face.mp4 --duration 3
```

### False Positives/Negatives
```bash
# Lower confidence threshold if hands not detected
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --scare-conf 0.95

# Higher confidence if too many false positives  
python scripts/yolo_vlc_projection.py --scare-conf 0.99
```
